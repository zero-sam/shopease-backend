🛒 ShopEase Backend

ShopEase is a modern e-commerce platform backend built using the MERN stack, designed to empower small businesses and local sellers with a scalable, secure, and user-friendly online shopping experience.
This backend handles user management, authentication, and product listings, and is built to scale for features like orders and payments.
✅ What Has Been Implemented So Far
1. 👥 User Model with Role Support

    Defined a detailed user schema in /models/User.js.

    Supports three roles: buyer, seller, and admin.

    Includes:

        Secure password hashing using bcrypt middleware.

        Sub-schemas for addresses and bank details.

        Fields for seller verification.

2. 🔐 User Authentication

    Created registration and login routes/controllers:

        /routes/auth.js

        /controllers/authController.js

    Separate registration endpoints for buyers and sellers with role distinction.

    Implemented JWT-based authentication:

        Token generation during login.

        Middleware for JWT verification: /middleware/auth.js

        Middleware for role-based access control: /middleware/roleAuth.js

3. 👤 Profile Endpoint

    Created /api/auth/me to securely retrieve the currently logged-in user's information.

4. 📦 Product Management

    Product schema defined in /models/Product.js with fields:

        name, description, price, category, images, inventory, and seller reference.

    Product routes in /routes/products.js:

        Sellers can: create, update, and delete products.

        Buyers & Sellers can: view and list products.

    Controllers ensure:

        Proper role validation.

        Ownership checks for updates/deletion.

5. ⚙️ Backend Setup & MongoDB Integration

    Connected to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.

    Configured environment variables in .env:

        Database URI

        JWT secret

        Port

    Connection uses modern serverApi options.

    Used .gitignore to exclude sensitive data and node_modules.

6. 💻 GitHub & Version Control

    Clean and structured GitHub repo.

    Used GitHub Desktop for commits and pushes.

    Excluded unnecessary files to keep the repo clean.
